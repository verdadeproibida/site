## Testing a headline

Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871â€“1948), a professional accountant, discovered the underlying social principles and developed the analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call ["Elliott waves"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle ""Elliott waves""), or simply "waves". 

### Testing a subheadline

Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book The Wave Principle in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939, and covered it most comprehensively in his final major work, Nature's Laws: The Secret of the Universe in 1946.

Elliott stated that "because man is subject to rhythmical procedure, calculations having to do with his activities can be projected far into the future with a justification and certainty heretofore unattainable." [1] The empirical validity of the Elliott Wave Principle remains the subject of debate.
